# What?
This was a project for my AP American History class in which we had to tie our techincal field of study into this period of American History. We had to pick a form of media to present it in, I chose a website and a live presentation. What you will find in this repo is this website portion

# Why?
For my other projects I have been working it, it has become increasingly important that I learn to program HTML and CSS for the visual portion, like My Local_Mechatronics_Server project. Because of this I chose the perfect time to learn something new, School!

            <h1>Engineering</h1>

            <h2>My tech shop is AET, which stands for "Applied Engineering Technology"</h2>
            <h3>What does this mean?</h3>
            <p>My tech shop covers a varying number of engineering topics, which includes computer engineering, electrical engineering and some mechanical</p>
            <p>However, for the sake of breveity, I will be sticking to electrical engineering </p>
            <h3>Modern day</h3>
            <p>Modern day electrical engineering plays a pivtol role in society. I can promise you everything in this class has had something to do with electrical engineering</p>
            <h3>Era 6</h3>
            <p>Now, 1845-1900 is quite an important time in American History. as this is the time in which Edison and Tesla has their famous debate </p>
            <p>This debate is the decider of which system would be used in the average home, AC or DC power system </p>
            <h2>How did Engineering look during this era?</h2>
            <h3>The Worlds Fair</h3>
            <p>The worlds fair was a primary component in the engineering world during this time period</p>
            <p>the worlds fair was the primary way that people got their ideas out to the public, it was the social media of its time</p>
            <p>The worlds fair during this time period was going to debut the biggest discovery yet, the AC power system, which would change the world as we know it</p>
            <h3>The Turn of An Era</h3>
            <p>During this time period, elecctricty and its potential had come to a public eye for the first time ever</p>
            <p>Many engineers are on the brink of discovery </p>
            <p>I personally would have loved to be an engineer during this period of time, to figure out new things and be on the brink of a new generation</p>
            <h3>New Technologies</h3>
            <p>This time in history marks the first time where electricty is in the public eye and in houses </p>
            <p>Electricty is now being put into the average Americans home for the first time, greatly saving on costs and even saftey by removing the candle</p>
            <h2>How Time Has Changed Things</h2>
            <h3>Whats being invented</h3>
            <p>Today, almost everything is electrical, electrical engineering is one of the most sought after jobs</p>
            <p>In todays day and age its hard to imagine life without electricty or our modern day ease of life</p>
            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>Being educated to be an electrical engineer is so much easier now in comparison, look at me im in highschool doing it</p>
            <p>Back then it would be extremely difficult to find a way to educated yourself in this topic</p>
            <h3>How Time Hasnt Changed a Thing</h3>
            <p>the big point here is to remember that people still invent to this day</p>
            <p>No matter how much time passes, engineering will always stay the same, in the sense that you are inventing</p>
            <p>Your whole job is to invent things, tinker and create new things</p>
